## Setting up Locally

3. Run `yarn && yarn dev`

## Thought Process

- With a limited time to get this assignment completed, I decided to prioritize some tasks over others:
  - Prioritized:
    - Functionality
    - UI
  - Deprioritized:
    - Testing
    - Bundle Size (Decided to use ThirdParty libraries to quickly add functionality)

## Next Steps - If I had more time
- Add Unit Tests
- Improve UI
  - More form validation
  - Improve loading/error states
- Abstract Code
